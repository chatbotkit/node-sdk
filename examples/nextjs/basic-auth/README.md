Welcome to this example project that showcases the integration of the ChatBotKit Partner API with NextAuth.js. This project is designed to provide you with a clear and practical demonstration of how to leverage the powerful features of the ChatBotKit Partner API alongside the NextAuth.js library in a Next.js environment to create a basic yet functional authentication flow.

This is the most straightforward way to build quick AI applications with ChatBotKit without having to worry about the complexities of building a backend.

## Getting Started

From the root of the ChatBotKit Node SDK monorepo:

```bash
pnpm -F @examples/nextjs-basic-auth dev
```

As a standalone application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
